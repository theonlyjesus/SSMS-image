# Using the SQL Server Container After Setup

Your SQL Server and schema live in the sqlcontainer Docker container.

## Connecting to SQL Server from Azure Data Studio.

- Open Azure Data Studio.

- The db connection is localhost.
- Select Advanced...
- Under General, set Port to 1433.
- Select OK
- User name is sa
- Password is Appl3s123

## Connecting to SQL Server from a local Parallels Windows VM after setup

- If you haven't set up your VM to connect to the SQL Server container, skip to the optional step below.
- Open your database GUI.
- The db connection is localmac, port 1433.
- Username is sa
- Password is Appl3s123

## Start Container Command
`docker start sqlcontainer`

## Stop Container Command
`docker stop sqlcontainer`

## Delete Container Command
`docker rm sqlcontainer`

# (Optional step) Setup to connect from your Parallels Windows VM.

- Run Notepad as Administrator

- From Notepad, File > Open, open System32 > drivers > etc > hosts (may need to change file extension to show all file types)

- Inside the hosts file, add `10.211.55.2  localmac`. (This IP address is the default value for Mac Terminal > ifconfig > vnic0 > inet. If the default value doesnâ€™t work, find the inet address for your device and add it to the hosts file.)

- http://localmac:[port] will be able to access apps and ports in your Windows VM served from your mac
